Build:

mvn clean install

Run:

java -jar substring-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar abcd a*c

Problem:

Write a program that takes 2 string parameters from the command line.
Program must verify if the second string is a substring of the first string
(you cannot use substr, substring or any other standard function
including regular expression libraries).

Each occurrence of * in the second substring means that it can be a match for
zero or more characters of the first string.

Consider the example:
Input string 1: abcd
Input string 2: a*c
Program should evaluate that the string 2 is a substring of the string 1.

Additionally asterisk (*) may be considered as a regular character, if it
is preceded by a backslash (\).  Backslash (\) is considered as a regular
character in all cases other than preceding the asterisk (*).
